Zero → Legend: Interactive CS & Systems
======================================

How to use
----------
1) Unzip the package.
2) Open `index.html` in your browser.
3) Your progress is stored locally (localStorage). To reset, click the ⟲ button.

Notes
-----
- This starter includes 520 lessons (80+ with real content; the rest are structured deep-dive slots you can fill).
- The site is a small, dependency-free SPA (just HTML/CSS/JS) and works offline.
- Lessons are plain Markdown files. Add or edit them under /lessons and update titles in /lessons/manifest.json.
- Quizzes use the inline syntax:  :::quiz Question? || Option A || Option B* || Option C :::  (* marks correct)
- Each lesson shows “Choose your path” cards to jump forward; you can customize the `next` array per lesson in the manifest.

Customize
---------
- Colors & theme: edit CSS variables at the top of style.css.
- Add sections: create new categories in `manifest.json` and place markdown files accordingly.
- Deploy: host on any static hosting (GitHub Pages, Netlify, Vercel, etc.).
